# location-aware-reminders
 
A reminder application that uses generic location types to trigger reminders.
 
 _Instead of creating a reminder to buy milk the next time Iâ€™m at the local Tesco, remind me to buy milk any time I walk past a supermarket/corner shop/minimarket_.

## Spatial techniques used
